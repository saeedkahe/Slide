### Sheet Slider

### Hello👋
Welcome to the slide show.❤️<br>
In this exercise, we come to the important topic of transform.<br>

### first 
<hr>
In the first step, we create the HTML file.<br>
We create our own div inside the HTML file. We must be careful to consider a parent for the children.<br>

### second
<hr>
In the second step, we create our own style file.<br>
I used the styling inside the HTML file here. My suggestion to you is to make a CSS file.<br>
In the second step, we rate the children according to their position.<br>
Now we have to write hover for them.<br>
I preferred that by hovering, each of the children get transform rotate and separate from each other.<br>
You can set the value in any way you like.<br>

### Good luck!😘
